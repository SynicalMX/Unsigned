# Unsigned

A game dev should never have to always worry about exploiters.

## What is it?

Unsigned is a module for ROBLOX development that skewers the RemoteEvents and RemoteFunctions so exploiters cannot interact with them.

## How does it work?

Suprisingly, Unsigned hides the remotes fairly simply. If the object doesn't have a parent, how will you be able to fire it? Onto that, the remote's name is always different and constantly changing. Unsigned runs only on the client, so you're server won't look like a jumbled mess when in-game.

## See it in action!

Here is a [live example](https://www.roblox.com/games/12864529170/Unsigned-Example) showing the capabilities of Unsigned!

The example is also uncopylocked and free for you to check out.
